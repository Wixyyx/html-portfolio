<h1>My Top 3 Best Mangas</h1>
<hr />
<h2>One Piece</h2>
The best manga in the world! I have no words to describe that. Oda is a genius.
<br />
<h2>Hajime no Ippo</h2>
The author does an incredible job of developing both the main and secondary characters. If you love boxing, you have to read this manga, the fights are wonderful.
<br />
<h2>Vinland Saga</h2>
Vikings. Fight. Deep reflections. No more words.
